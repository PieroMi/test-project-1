2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) [YOUR ANSWER HERE]
  I really wanted to generate a random sequence of colors while making it harder for the player as they continued to win. 
  I was able to understand that by using the Math.random method I would be able to accomplish my goal. 
  I had learned in previous programming classes abotu generating random numbers when I implemnted it on a dice game. 
  However, it was done in Java and not Js so the challenging part was being able to figure out how to apply it to js
3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) [YOUR ANSWER HERE]
  My question at the moment about web development is how can I add a celebratory confetti animation whenever the player won? I tried multiple times to be able to apply it when the function wonGame() was triggered.
  My assumption is that I did not understand the logic behind it and how I could apply it whenever the player won
4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) YOUR ANSWER HERE]
  I would definitely add the confetti animation when player won the game, I would also like to add a level demonstrator so as the player continued to win the level of difficulty would show on the simon says. Pretty much incrementing level every round.
  I thought about getting creative so I added the 'Do-Re-Mi-Fa' sound into the buttons rather than any simple sound, however I wanted to add 4 different sounds that made sense in any way the sequence of button would have been played.
